Subject Number,"Q10. Following Q9, can you give an example of how these learning activities have helped you?"
1,"The presentation helps me figure out the main structure of the research abstract and what is the necessary element for a good research question.
The python activity helps me to develop a certain interest in quantitative research."
2,I learned to draw Lucicharts through class presentation
3,It helps me design the signature research question
4,Simulate economic cases using python helps me to have a basic understanding of how python work and how it helps us to analyzing data.
5,"My peers have different opinions with me. We do different literature reviews, so after communicating with each other, we know more knowledges."
6,I learned more about the use of python in doing simulations.
7,Make me understand the concept and know how to apply them better 
8,"the debate of this class exposure me to the unfamiliar concepts of macro economy. more importantly, it really makes me think about both sides of those concepts."
9,"It's my first time using python to conduct the simulation. It really makes me have an idea of how the control variable method works. And during the process, it makes the abstract things more concrete, for example, by the means of visualization. "
10,I think it inspires me to learn more about python and consider different perspectives when doing research. 
11,problem set help me to better my research skills
12,Reflection on the concept make me understand the basics.
13,Gaining some basic research methods
14,"Actually, my SW will not focus on the economic area. "
15,I think the final project helped us develop more idea for signature work.
16,"I didn't access Python a lot prior to this class. But in this class I learn how to use Python API (especially the Co-lab files are very useful), which benefited me in data analysis skills. "
17,the debate help me to prepare for speech quickly
18,No
19,Presentation and week6 lecture have helped me learn the cryptocurrency a lot which I had no knowledge before.
20,Endowed me with the concept and research method of simulation.
21,"these activities inspire me to think about potential research topics for the signature work
"
22,python could help me do my future research
23,I have a better understanding of monetary policy through the debate.
24,"It helped me to know how to visualize the research result, for example, the relationship between interest rate and economic growth."
25,Lecture especially helps me understands everything!
26,presentation??? coming up with 
27,good!
28,I think the debate for Pro & Con gives me an insight of a specific question that I want to find the answer of: whether it is good or not.
